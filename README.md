# solid_gemc

overview
--------
This repository is for [SoLID](https://solid.jlab.org) simulation based on [GEMC](https://gemc.jlab.org).

It includes all codes of defining and running simulation, digitizing and analyzing results.

It should be run with container from [solid_release](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/solid_release) which has prerequisites included. 

Read [gemc simulation general note](https://solid.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Gemc_simulation_general_note) and [solid software wiki](https://solid.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Software)

To run solid_gemc from plain-language requests with Claude Code or Codex CLI, use the [solid-gemc-claude](https://github.com/zhaozhiwen/solid_gemc_claude) skill.

code structure
--------

you can ask questions using [deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc)

* "geometry", detector definition
* "field" field definition
* "script" example script to run simulation
* "digitization" code to digitize simulation output 
* "analysis" code to analyze results and do some studies
* "source" source code of solid_gemc which add solid specific hit process routine and load gemc as library
* "mod" some modification of original gemc code to fit solid need
* "prototype" code for solid prototype simulation


development rule and how to contribute
--------
* Use "master" branch as devel version and github release as production version
* most small development will be done by "fork->modify->submit pull request" mode.
* some major collaborative development can be done with "branch->modify->submit pull request" mode as needed 

To keep your fork in sync, do it simply on github. the alternative is do it on your computer as follows
* git clone https://github.com/[your_github_name]/solid_gemc.git
* git remote add upstream https://github.com/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc.git
* git fetch upstream
* git checkout master
* git merge upstream/master
* git push origin masters
