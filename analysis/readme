Here is a set of scripts to process root tree output from solid_gemc

The root file has different trees from different hit process of different ditectors.
Each tree is processed by an independent routine, they are called by the main analysis routine which process event by event and combine the result.
flux tree used for the virtual detectors is processed in the main analysis

run the scripts with compliation to avoid error or slowness

for example

root[0].x analysis_PVDIS.C+("solid_gemc_output.root")

root[0].x analysis_SIDIS_He3.C+("solid_gemc_output.root")
