2014/06/05 =================================================
geometry file convert from GEMC1 format to GEMC2 format,
old files based on rev 457 with some small modifications

To see changes, it's best to compare an old file and new file
main changes are
0. output geometry into a text file instead mysql database
1. header changes because IO engine changes
2. add "my %detector=init_det();" 
3. replace "print_det(\%configuration, \%detector);"
4. doesn't allow "" entry anymore
5. only lower case "flux" works, "FLUX" won't
6. add "*counts" for number of planes for polycone shape
