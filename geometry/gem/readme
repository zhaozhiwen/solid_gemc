= Intro ===================

Here is EC simulation setup using "solid_gemc" which is the SoLID simulation program based on GEMC

The setup gives a complete definition of the detector.
How to run the simulation and analysis result is not here, they are at "subsystem/gem/analysis"

It's devel version is at "subsystem/gem/gem_solid_gemc"

Once it's verified working well itself and with other subsystems, its devel version is copied
to the production version location at "solid_gemc2/geometry/gem" with no modification needed

This is to ensure the same setup works as standalone and as part of the whole SoLID simulation

= detail ===================

detector definition are in text files.
It include geometry and sensitivity,material,mirror,hit,bank defination.
The perl scripts is are producde these text files
Except the parameter text file has all external parameter, it is edit by hand.

A perl script will call other perl scripts and use parameter file to produce all other texts by running command below
source your set_solid
./solid_PVDIS_gem.pl config_solid_PVDIS_gem.dat
./solid_SIDIS_gem.pl config_solid_SIDIS_gem.dat

The hit defination, bank definations and corresponding hit processing rouine "solid_gem" of "solid_gemc" have to match producde meaningful result.
Any change in hit defination and bank defination, you need to modify the source code "solid_gem" accordingly and recompile "solid_gemc" by following instruction there
