here are some scripts to submit farm job for solid simulation

To use it, do the following
====================================================
login in ifarm
copy all files into a dir 
edit "solid.gcard" and "do_it_all.sh" for your simulation need
run "LongRun_sim" and give start and end run numbers
job submission scripts like "jsc2000" will be created according to "exec_sim", "do_it_all.sh" and "solid.gcard" will be copied to farm, and all jobs will be submitted.
wait for output files, out.*.evio, out.*.root and out.*.log will appear in the dir
If any job fails, you may only see out.*.log files, check files at ~/.farm_out for detailed reason
====================================================

You may use "hadd" to add all resulting root files into a single one.
