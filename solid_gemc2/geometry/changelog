2014/06/05 =================================================
soldi CLEO geometry files are converted from GEMC 1 format to GEMC 2 format,
They are based on old files at svn revision 457 with some modifications.

we output geometry into a text file instead mysql database
CLEO is removed from the names

For detailed changes in geometry description, it's best to compare an old file and new file
The main changes are
1. header changes because IO engine changes
2. add "my %detector=init_det();" 
3. replace "print_det(\%detector, $file);" with "print_det(\%configuration, \%detector);"
4. doesn't allow "" entry anymore
5. only lower case "flux" works, "FLUX" won't
6. add "*counts" for number of planes for polycone shape
