2014/08/20 =================================================
solid_material.pl is added by Zhihong Ye
There are builtin material in GEMC like "Kryptonite", and some isotopes.
All SoLID materials are defined here, should have name "SL_*"
All geometry files are modified to use SoLID materials.
GEMC devel version still takes material builtin its cpp source code, but it will be removed later.

2014/06/05 =================================================
soldi CLEO geometry files are converted from GEMC 1 format to GEMC 2 format,
They are based on old files at svn revision 457 with some modifications and bug fix here and there

we output geometry into a text file instead mysql database
CLEO is removed from the names

For detailed changes in geometry description, it's best to compare an old file and new file
The main changes are
1. header changes because IO engine changes
2. add "my %detector=init_det();" 
3. replace "print_det(\%detector, $file);" with "print_det(\%configuration, \%detector);"
4. doesn't allow "" entry anymore
5. only lower case "flux" works, "FLUX" won't
6. add "*counts" for number of planes for polycone shape
