9/19/2014
- Fixed initialization routine for cases where WRITE_RAWS is disabled.

8/13/2014
- Added extra condition to remove unnecessary verbosity

8/8/2014
- Removing condition on tree filling as ROOT does the right thing
  when filling a tree with no entries: the event number get increased
  but the tree entry is empty.

8/6/2014
- Typo on WRITE_RAWS type
- Not defining true info variables if WRITE is off.

8/5/2014
- Added verbosity on tree creation
- Filling tree for every event (with -9999 if bank not present). This will sync all events.

- README added

5/27/14
- evio2root beta finalized, time for testing
- added test.C root macro
- bank scheme changed as requested from Hall-B software group
  Reason: makes it more readable by 3rd party software.
  I'm opposed to this, I think we should be driven by human readability instead of 3rd party software
  from:
  Mother (tag, 0)
   daughter (tag, daughter id)
    vars (tag + daughter id, variable id)
  to:
  Mother (tag, 0)
   daughter (tag + daughter id, 0)
    vars (tag + daughter id, variable id)

  hit number now changed num from 0 to 99
