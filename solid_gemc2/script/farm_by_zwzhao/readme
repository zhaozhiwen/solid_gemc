here are some scripts to submit farm job for solid simulation

To use it, do the following
====================================================
login in ifarm
copy all files into a dir 
copy your gcard to this dir and name it "solid.gcard"
edit "solid.gcard" to make the evio output file name "out.evio"
run "LongRun_sim" and give start and end run numbers
job submission scripts will be created according to "exec_sim", "do_it_all.sh" will be copied to farm, and all jobs will be submitted.
wait for output files, out.*.evio, out.*.root and out.*.log will appear in the dir
If any job fails, you may only see out.*.log files, check files at ~/.farm_out for detailed reason
====================================================

You may use TChain to read all root files at once or use "hadd" to add all root files into a single one.

by default, it use the official solid simulation installation on ifarm, to change it edit the file "do_it_all.sh"
