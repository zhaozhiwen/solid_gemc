== for users ===
This is to build "solid_gemc" with GEMC library to add addtional functionality like hitprocess and so on.

source your set_solid
cd $GEMC/source
scons OTP=1 LIBRARY="shared"  <this will produce libgemc.so>

At this dir, run "scons OPT=1", this will create "solid_gemc" binary, you can use it with all feature of GEMC and addtional things we added here

== for expert users ===

This package is to update and replace "solgemc" to make it work with GEMC 2

hitprocess/solid_hitprocess.h and gemc.cc are needed for now.
They could be removed once GEMC change to make hitprocess like real plugin
