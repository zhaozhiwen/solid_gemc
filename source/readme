This is to build "solid_gemc" with GEMC library to add addtional functionality like hitprocess etc

solid_gemc follow same version number of gemc to be 100% compatiable

source your set_solid
cd $GEMC_VERSION
run "scons OPT=1", this will create "solid_gemc" binary, you can use it with all feature of GEMC and addtional things we added here

== for expert users ===

This package replace "solgemc" to make it work with GEMC 2

How it works
1. copy gemc.cc from gemc main code and change its name to solid_gemc.cc
2. add two lines below in solid_gemc.cc 
#include "solid_hitprocess.h"
solid_hitprocess(hitProcessMap);	
3. make new hit process routine in hitprocess dir, buy copy and modify from others
4. add new  hit process code in SConstruct, ready for compile

The GEMC lib libgemc.so is produced by default when it is installed. here is its actual command

cd $GEMC/source
scons OTP=1 LIBRARY="shared"
